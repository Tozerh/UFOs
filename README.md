# UFOs
*Project Overview*:

In this challenge, we were asked to write work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS styling in order to construct a web page to host UFO data and filters to comb through this data. 

*Resources*:

Code and Software: JavaScript (+ D3.js JavaScript library), HTML, & CSS.

## *Results*

### *How to Perform a Search* 

The search functionality on our page is relatively robust and easy to navigate. Our data table is searchable based on five criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape:

All you need to do to search is to input your desired data into each field and then press "Enter" on your keyboard (or the equivalent), which will then execute the search based on your populated criteria:

### *Summary*

- One drawback of my page is that the search results table spills over with too many results, and ends up being positioned below the filter fields. It would be much neater if the search results always sat beside the filter fields. 

Two additional recommendations:
- I would suggest creating a map object as well that could display the filtered search criteria on a map, with individual pop-ups for UFO sighting returned. 

- I would also suggest that the user be given an option to filter the search table based on each of the individual fields. E.g., the user could select ("Duration") in order to filter the results based on the duration column.
