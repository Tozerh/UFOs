# UFOs
*Project Overview*:

In this challenge, we were asked to write work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS styling in order to construct a web page to host UFO data and filters to comb through this data. 

*Resources*:

Code and Software: JavaScript (+ D3.js JavaScript library), HTML, & CSS.

## *Results*

### *How to Perform a Search* 

The search functionality on our page is relatively robust and easy to navigate. Our data table is searchable based on five criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape:

All you need to do to search is to input your desired data into each field and then press "Enter" on your keyboard (or the equivalent), which will then execute the search based on your populated criteria:


### *High level overview and two additional queries:*

Generally, the month of June should be more profitable for the surf/ice cream parlor. Minimum temperatures are much higher in June than in December, and we should expect more foot traffic earlier in the day and later into the evening due to warmer temperatures. 

Two additional queries: 
- I would suggest querying information on sunrise and sunset times, which should help optimize store opening/closing hours based on month. I would expect that there will be significantly more hours of sunlight in June than in December, which might necessitate different hours of operation and staffing. 
- Additionally, a query involving tidal charts (low and high tide) would be really helpful to dial in stafffing related to the "surf" portion of the concept. It would be useful to know when to expect the best wave conditions month-to-month to allow for additional or reduced surf staffing, as the case may be.
